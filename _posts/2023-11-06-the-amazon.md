NOTE: this post is a work-in-progress, and will not make complete sense yet :)

During my final year of college, my friend Kyle and I made the impulsive
decision to book flights to Colombia to visit the Amazon rainforest - about 10
days before said flights departed. Not the most last-minute flight I've bought,
but still a pretty ambitious timeline considering the destination. We then went
into panic mode, scrambling to get the necessary vaccines, anti-malarial
medications, and supplies we'd need.

<!-- Mexico city layover -->
On our way to Colombia, we ended up having quite a long layover in Mexico City,
so we stashed our bags and grabbed a couple buses towards the downtown area. One
of the buses ended up being the wrong one, so after being dumped somewhere
random, wandering around trying to get to several metro stations that all ended
up being abandoned, we gave up and called an Uber. That took us to a really cool
central square, where we had some awesome street tacos, listened to some live mariachi
music, and wandered around for a while longer until we needed to get back to the
airport.

<!-- TO-DO: add content -->
Next stop, Bogota. We spent an amazing few days there, before boarding a
domestic flight to an isolated town called Leticia. Leticia is not connected by
road to the rest of Colombia, and so is only accessible by air or water, which
is pretty wild.

Upon landing in Leticia, the heat and humidity immediately hit like a truck - a
marked contrast to the cool mountain air of Bogota. The airport is close enough
to the town that you can walk between them, which we did. It's definitely a
novel experience to do that; there aren't too many places you can.

After decompressing at our hostel for a minute, we started wandering around the
town. This was quite the perspective-shifting experience for me, as things were
incredible different there. Here's part of the town we walked through:

Due to massive seasonal fluctuations in water levels, many structures are built
on stilts like these houses.

Eventually, we made our way to a busy market area down by the river, and
got stopped by a friendly dude named Juan Carlos. He wanted to take us out on
the river for sunset. Initially we were wary, but eventually decided to take him
up on his offer. We walked out onto a dock-like structure through a maze of
precariously-balanced wooden planks, where he had a small boat waiting. Juan
slowly motored us out into the Amazon, but first pulled alongside an isolated
shack alongside the river. For a heart-stopping second, I thought we'd screwed
up, and were about to be robbed. It turned out we were just stopping to grab a
two-liter soda bottle filled with gas. We reached the middle of the river,
briefly crossing into Peru, and listened to Juan tell us about the river, the
surrounding area, and life in Leticia. I followed along as best I could (he only
spoke Spanish), and was encouraged to discover I wasn't completely lost.

Wandering through Leticia was a really interesting experience. There's
definitely a tourist presence, but nothing like most other places I've been.
Tourism here just feels a little different, and almost all the tourists speak
Spanish.

The next morning, we woke up and headed down to the docks again to take another
boat down the river to a small town called Santa Sofia. As previously mentioned,
there aren't too many roads in the area, and traveling on the river is the main
way people seemed to get around. After a pleasant few hours on the river, we got
off the boat and walked to the town with Francisco, a guy close to our own age
who happened to be the mayor of Santa Sofia and four other surrounding
communities. He told us a little bit about the communities there and we learned
just how small Santa Sofia actually is, with a population of only 800 people.

Stepping into the village itself almost felt like going back in time, with 
modern touches - like a cell tower - that seemed strangely incongruous with the
otherwise simple surroundings. We later learned that this cell tower only
provided coverage during certain hours of the day, when the power was on. It was
an eye-opening experience to be somewhere where electricity was a luxury not
taken for granted.

As dusk started to fall in the jungle, it was time to make the last part of our
journey to the reserve itself. With flashlights in hand, we made our way to a
small boat pulled up against an offshoot of the river that ran near the town. We
loaded our backpacks and ourselves into the boat, and we were off. By this time,
it was quite dark, and the huge trees surrounding us cast eerie shadows as we
wound our way through this narrow side channel of the Amazon. The chirp of
insects was occasionally punctuated by yells of "abajo!" as we ducked underneath
low-hanging branches and vines. At times, the jungle was so dense it felt like
we were traveling through a tunnel, and I worried our boat would get stuck.
Eventually, our guides pulled the boat up to the beginning of a narrow path
through the trees. We changed into heavy-duty rubber boots, and hiked through
the (by this time, pitch-black) jungle for a while longer until we reached the
hostel. Between the incredibly foreign surroundings and the darkness, this whole
journey had felt incredibly surreal.


I'm always amazed at the variety of fruits and vegetables that exist beyond
what's common in the United States. We ate a delicious fruit called "sapote",
which tasted like a combination of a mango and a pumpkin. Who even knew that
existed?


It was finally time for our real adventure. Before beginning our trek in
earnest, we prayed with our guides for protection at some of the largest trees
I'd ever seen - guardians of the jungle. We also stopped for a little vine
climbing.

We also learned that a certain type of ant is an excellent natural insect
repellent (unfortunately, one that only lasts for 15-ish minutes). We found
thousands of these ants covering their home, a nest-like structure made of
hardened mud attached to a tree. To apply, we just placed our hands on the ant
nest, waited a few seconds for hundreds of ants to crawl on our hands, and
then rubbed our hands together, killing the ants and spreading the repellent.
Pretty wild.


After such a long walk in the rain, this was some of the best food I've tasted
(also, seriously impressive that our guide managed to find fuel and start a fire
in these conditions).

The amount of water here is truly wild. With only a few hours of rain, the river
we camped next to rose at least a meter, if not more. Here's a picture:

And a glimpse into our camp setup:

We had another solid dinner of chicken and rice, although I have to say, it was
a little concerning eating chicken 36+ hours into a backpacking trip without
refrigeration... oh well, my digestive problems didn't manifest until the plane
ride home, so can't complain. (Can't say the same for Kyle though...) He tells
me getting up five times in the middle of the night in the middle of the Amazon
jungle is not pleasant, and comes with serious risk of being eaten by
god-knows-what.

On our way back to the reserve, the incessant rain had completely flooded the
trail we originally took. After quite a lot of backtracking and more than a few
false starts, we found a path that wasn't too flooded.

I got a compliment from one of the other travelers for not being scared to just
let rip with completely wrong Spanish that people somehow understand, so I guess
that's a win? I've been kinda forced to do that on this trip, which has been
really fun, and really good for my language abilities. A majority of the other
places I've been when people hear my Spanish they immediately switch to English,
so it was nice to discover I can in fact speak a useful amount. Anyway, that's
all for now. This was definitely one of the wilder, more perspective-shifting
travel experiences I've had.
