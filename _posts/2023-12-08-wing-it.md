For our senior capstone design project, we built an airfare search engine
targeted toward budget-friendly, flexible travelers. It was a ton of fun to work
on, and we ended up taking first place out of all capstone projects that year.
Depending on whether one of us is currently hosting the project, the
[live site](https://wingitflights.com) may or may not work.
