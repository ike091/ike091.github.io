I"ş<p>To take clear long exposure images of the night sky with exposures times past 30
seconds or so, some sort of tracking must be employed, since the Earthâ€™s
rotation will cause stars to blur/rotate across the frame.</p>

<p>Extremely expensive camera mounts exist that do this very well, but thereâ€™s a
cheaper and simpler way to accomplish something similar.  Itâ€™s called a â€œbarn
doorâ€ star tracker. Essentially, itâ€™s a hinge that slowly opens, exactly
countering the rotation of the earth.</p>

<p>I searched through quite a few online tutorials of pre-existing barn door
trackers, but since I had access to a 3D printer at school and some basic shop
tools, I thought it would be fun to create my own.</p>

<p>Using a few custom 3D-printed parts, some wood, a hinge, a cheap stepper motor,
and an Arduino, I was able to build a functioning star tracker:</p>
